# Worklog

Append only. Forensic history for humans, never a context source (DEC-011).
Mechanical prompt logging starts when hooks land (S005); until then entries are
appended by hand.

> read bootstrap.md and AGENTS.md, then work S001 from section 8

## 2026-08-01 recap S001

- Step: S001 scaffold, worked by hand per specs (pre-tooling).
- Changed: `.workflow.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`; `bootstrap.md` moved to `project/specs.md` and restructured (prime directive, INV-1..INV-12); `project/` tree per AGENTS.md §2; DEC-001..DEC-012 seeded newest first; plan.md ordering S001..S011 with one step file each; S001 completed into `plan_done/`.
- Tests: none yet (suite arrives S002). Manual invariant checks run and recorded in testing.md; first run caught missing `plan_done/`, fixed, re-run green.
- README/MANUAL: checked — both absent by plan (S011).
- Flagged: INV-8 append-only bytes vs decisions.md newest-first ordering conflict, routed to S004.
- Commits: 21a8226 (scaffold), 2fcbb94 (untrack stray `.claude/` temp file swept in by `git add -A`).

> What is the next step? All defered decisions or anything that i should decide now let's solce it in iteractive way now

> I will handle github configuration by myslef. You just create commits and nothing else. Untill new orders

> What would be most efficient way to handle decisions? Appending is faster but then you need to read the whole file and consume more tokens. if adding on top is something that will not require to read the whole file increasing the context the nlet's put on top, if not then on bottom

> bottom

## 2026-08-01 recap decisions ordering

- Not a step; rules and decisions turn.
- DEC-013: decisions.md newest last; AGENTS.md §2/§8 amended; DEC-001..DEC-012 reordered oldest first (one-time exception authorized by DEC-013); S004 reconcile clause dropped; superseding testing.md row appended.
- DEC-014: GitHub configuration is Max's own; agent commits only, until new orders.
- Commit: e8084d3
